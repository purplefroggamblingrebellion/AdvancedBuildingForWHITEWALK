# Advanced Building AND Import From Studio
## Quick Warning: DO NOT USE ADVANCED BUILDING OR IMPORT FROM STUDIO AND ASK FOR ARCHITECT, KEEP ARCHITECT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CAN BUILD WITH THE REAL SYSTEM

# Advanced Building:

Hello! This is a more advanced type of building for WHITEWALK.

![In use.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/purplefroggamblingrebellion/AdvancedBuildingForWHITEWALK/refs/heads/main/Inuse.png)

## KEYBINDS
R and T to rotate papers.
X to cancel placement. (If you clicked Place Grid, X removes the grid.)

Clicking build opens and closes the building system. (build is located under the donate button)

## Things it includes so far:
### Build At Feet:
This lets you build on a grid under your feet, helping your building in the sky, making platforms 10x easier.

*BUILD AT FEET IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE REGULAR PLACEMENT SYSTEM OF NOTES*

### Adjacent Paper
Click on a paper to see 4 points you can make an adjacent paper to, will build another paper perfectly adjacent to it, great for walls.
### Snap to Grid
Just set it to whatever number you want, and it'll snap.
### Place Grid
Click on the Place button next to it, and click on any surface of a paper. It'll make a grid on that surface, letting you place easier.

*PLACE GRID IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE REGULAR PLACEMENT SYSTEM OF NOTES*

EXECUTE THIS CODE TO USE ADVANCED BUILDING
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/purplefroggamblingrebellion/AdvancedBuildingForWHITEWALK/refs/heads/main/lua.txt"))()
```
You need an executor to run the code.
If you don't have one, use Solara. (This script has been fully tested in Solara.)
